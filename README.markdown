# Demo code from my Triangle JS talk "Learn Functional Programming by Implementing SQL"

Open demo.html to run the code. There are a few JS files

 * `blank.js` was our starting point for the live coding
 * `live.js` was where we finished
 * `cheat-sheet.js` contains some more of the SQL DSL fleshed out
    including select, select with aggregate operators (uses reduce!),
    and joins.

demo.html currently sources `live.js` but you can change this to the others
to try out.
